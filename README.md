# Sheridan's Auto Project

Hello, and welcome to my Automation Project!

I created this, primarily, to showcase my skills to potential employers. But if this happens to help anyone else on their learning journey, then that's great too.

I'm quite near the start of my journey into Test Automation and love learning more each day. This project follows a Page Object Model approach and uses:
C#,
.Net,
NUnit,
SpecFlow,
Selenium.

If you have feedback or pointers, let me know!
